Hi, welcome to the wonderful world of Squarebase

+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| Web-based access to your MySQL databases without programming. |
+---------------------------------------------------------------+

The basic idea is that Squarebase builds a database (called the "metabase") that describes the structure of the database.
The information in the metabase is used to show the contents of the database.

Notes:

1. All information (features, bugs, documentation, source code) can be found at http://squarebase.org.

2. The source code of Squarebase can be found in the Subversion repository at http://squarebase.org/svn
   Check out with the following command.
   $ svn checkout http://squarebase.org/svn

3. After checking out, perform the following command, because Subversion doesn't set the permissions right.
   $ make install

4. There is a demo database named inventory
   $ make inventory
