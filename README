Hi, welcome to the wonderful world of Squarebase

Squarebase gives you web-based access to your MySql databases without having to write a single line of programming code.

The basic idea is that Squarebase builds a database (called the "metabase") that describes the structure of the database.
The information in the metabase is used to format the forms to browse and edit the database.

After changing the structure of the database or the contents of the metabase, they can be synchronized again.

Interestingly, the metabase of a metabase (called the "squarebase") is the same for all metabases.

Notes:

1. Squarebase can be found in the Subversion repository at http://svn.xp-dev.com/svn/fransre-squarebase/
   Check out with the following command.
   $ svn checkout http://svn.xp-dev.com/svn/fransre-squarebase/

2. After checking out, perform the following command, because Subversion doesn't set the permissions right.
   $ make install

3. There is a demo database named inventory
   $ mysql < example/inventory.sql

4. Conventions
   a. Table names are plural (e.g. orders instead of order)
   b. Each table has exactly 1 auto_increment field that is the primary key
   c. All foreign key fields have the singular form of table name they are referring to in their name (e.g. orderID)
